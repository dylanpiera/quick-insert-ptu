# Quick Insert - Search Widget (PTU Compatability branch)
This is a copy of Quick Insert by Sunspots (https://gitlab.com/fvtt-modules-lab/quick-insert). 

Personally I don't know how to compile a Foundry module which is using TypeScript, but I quickly wanted Foundry 0.8.* compatability. 
So I took the compiled version and edited some JS to make it run in 0.8.*

I won't be updating this and I can't promise this will work, but while I'm developing the 0.8 compatible version of my System I was badly missing QuicK Insert so I quickly made this patch.

Please support the original author :)
